  Petal is a set of HEEX components that makes it easy for Phoenix developers to start building beautiful web apps.
</p>

## About

Petal stands for:

* [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/) (optional)
* [Live View (HEEX)](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html)

Some components like Dropdowns require Javascript to work. We default to Alpine JS (17kb) but you can choose to use `Phoenix.LiveView.JS` as an alternative (though this will only work in live environments like live views or live components).
